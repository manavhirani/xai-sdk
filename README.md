# Wannabe xAI SDK

This repo is a wannabe xAI SDK atm, you can litterally not do much with it,
let's where the devs take it

Potential TODO's

- Leverage live information extraction as an API functionality
- Simplify the infrastructure, don't be an OpenAI/Anthropic Copy
- Keep what's necessary, focus on dev experience
